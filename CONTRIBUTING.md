## Development Workflows

### Adding New Templates

1. **Create template directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p templates/framework/language/template-name
   ```

2. **Add template files**
   - Include all necessary files for a basic project
   - Use placeholders like `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` for dynamic content
   - Include a `package.json` with appropriate dependencies

3. **Update template resolver**
   - Add your template to the appropriate framework in `src/utils/templateResolver.ts`
   - Add template metadata and configuration

4. **Test the template**
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js create test-project
   # Select your new template and verify it works
   ```

### Adding New Features

1. **Define feature structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p features/feature-name/framework/language
   ```

2. **Create feature files**
   - Add all necessary configuration files
   - Include installation scripts if needed
   - Add documentation files

3. **Update feature installer**
   - Add your feature to `SUPPORTED_FEATURES` in `src/utils/featureInstaller.ts`
   - Implement the installation logic

4. **Test the feature**
   ```bash
   cd existing-project
   node /path/to/pi/dist/index.js add your-feature
   ```

### Command Development

When adding or modifying commands:

1. **Update command file**
   - Commands are in `src/commands/`
   - Include proper help functionality
   - Add error handling

2. **Update index.ts**
   - Register the command in the main CLI
   - Add proper description and arguments

3. **Add help documentation**
   - Each command should have a `showCommandHelp()` function
   - Include usage examples and options

## Debugging Tips

### Local Development

```bash
# Build and test changes
pnpm run build
node dist/index.js --help

# Test specific commands
node dist/index.js create test-app
node dist/index.js check
node dist/index.js add auth
```

### Common Issues

1. **Path Resolution**: Ensure file paths work in both development and production
2. **Template Variables**: Test variable replacement in templates
3. **Dependency Installation**: Verify package manager detection and installation
4. **Cross-Platform**: Test on different operating systems
