# 🚀 Package Installer CLI: Modern Web App Scaffolding Made Easy

Package Installer CLI is a powerful tool designed to help developers scaffold modern web applications with ease. Supporting multiple frameworks, languages, UI libraries, and now **database-specific ORM selection**, it streamlines project setup and dependency management.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Interactive CLI** with beautiful UI and strict prompt order
- **Argument-based project name** (supports `pi my-app` or `pi .` for current directory)
- **Framework, language, and UI library selection**
- **Dynamic database & ORM selection** (ORMs shown are specific to the selected database)
- **Automatic dependency installation** (`pnpm` or `npm`)
- **Cross-platform path handling**
- **Graceful exit and error messaging**
- **Combination templates** for full-stack setups

## 🆕 What's New: Database-Specific ORM Selection

The CLI now reads from `template.json` to show only the ORMs relevant to the selected database. For example, when creating a Next.js project, you'll first choose a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB), and then only see the ORMs that work with that database.

<Highlight>
{`
if (database && fwConfig.databases[database] && Array.isArray(fwConfig.databases[database].orms)) {
  const dbOrms = fwConfig.databases[database].orms;
  if (dbOrms.length > 0) {
    // Prompt for ORM selection
  }
}
`}
</Highlight>

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Run the CLI:**
   ```bash
   pi my-app
   # or
   package-installer my-app
   ```
2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Project name
   - Framework
   - Language
   - UI library (if available)
   - Bundler, src directory, Tailwind CSS (framework-specific)
   - Database & ORM (Next.js and others)
3. **Project is scaffolded and dependencies installed automatically.**

## 📋 Example Workflow

```bash
$ pi my-app
🚀 Choose a framework: Next.js
💻 Choose a language: TypeScript
🧩 Do you want to add a UI library? Yes
✨ Choose a UI library: Shadcn
📦 Choose a bundler: Vite
📂 Do you want a src directory? Yes
🎨 Do you want to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
🗄️ Choose a database: PostgreSQL
🔧 Choose an ORM: Prisma
```

## 🎯 Why Use Package Installer CLI?

- **Saves time**: No more manual setup
- **Ensures best practices**: Pre-configured templates
- **Flexible**: Supports frontend, backend, and full-stack setups
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new frameworks, databases, and ORMs via `template.json`

## 📦 Get Started

```bash
npm install -g package-installer-cli
pi my-app
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Use `pi .` to scaffold in the current directory
- Check the generated `README.md` for next steps
- Visit framework docs for advanced features
