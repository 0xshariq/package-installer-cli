# package-installer-cli — Monorepo

A monorepo that contains the official cross-platform interactive CLI for scaffolding modern application templates and several language-specific wrapper projects and bundles.

This repository groups multiple packages and artifacts used to build, bundle and distribute the `package-installer` CLI (the `pi` / `package-installer` binary). Converting to a monorepo keeps related projects together, simplifies releases, and makes it easier to maintain shared templates and build scripts.

## Monorepo layout

Top-level folders you'll commonly use:

- `typescript-main/` — The main TypeScript CLI implementation (core). Contains `package.json`, `src/`, build scripts and the `pi` CLI. Versioned independently (see `typescript-main/package.json`).
- `python-wrapper/`, `ruby-wrapper/`, `rust-wrapper/`, `go-wrapper/` — Language-specific wrappers that adapt the CLI or provide language integrations where applicable.
- `homebrew-tap/` — Homebrew tap for macOS installations.
- `bundle-executables/`, `bundle-standalone/`, `binary/` — Bundled distributions and prebuilt binaries for different platforms.
- `templates/` — Project templates used by the CLI to scaffold new projects.
- `docs/` and `features/` — Documentation and feature definitions for templates and integrations.

## Quick start (local development)

Prerequisites: Node.js (>=18 recommended), pnpm (preferred), or npm/yarn.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xshariq/package-installer-cli.git
cd package-installer-cli
```

2. Work with the TypeScript core (recommended):

```bash
cd typescript-main
# install dependencies (pnpm preferred since lockfile exists)
pnpm install

# build the CLI
pnpm run build

# run locally
pnpm start

# or, using npm
npm install
npm run build
node ./dist/index.js
```

3. Work with other packages

Each wrapper or subpackage is self-contained. To develop a wrapper or build a bundled executable, `cd` into that folder and follow its `README` or run its scripts. For example, to work with the Rust wrapper:

```bash
cd rust-wrapper
# follow the folder's README / use cargo build there
```

## Common tasks

- Build core CLI: `cd typescript-main && pnpm run build`
- Run CLI locally: `cd typescript-main && pnpm start` (or `node ./dist/index.js`)
- Create distribution bundles: `cd typescript-main && pnpm run build && pnpm run binary && pnpm run bundle` (you can use any package manager other than pnpm)
- Clean builds (dist folder): `cd typescript-main && pnpm run clean`

## Contribution & development workflow

- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines, commit messages, and release process.
- When modifying templates, add tests or an example scaffold run to verify the generated project.
- Keep distribution bundles out of commits; they are generated by build scripts.

## Releases & packaging

Release steps typically involve:

1. Bumping the version in the package (see `typescript-main/package.json`).
2. Building the core and creating distribution bundles (`pnpm run build`, then `pnpm run binary`, and lastly `pnpm run bundle`).
3. Publishing packages or uploading release assets (binaries, installers, Homebrew tap updates).

Automations (CI) may exist in `.github/workflows/` inside package folders — check each package for its own CI configuration.

## Repository READMEs (paths)

Open these files to add package badges or package-specific information:

- Root README: `README.md`
- TypeScript core: `typescript-main/README.md`
- Python wrapper: `python-wrapper/README.md`
- Ruby wrapper: `ruby-wrapper/README.md`
