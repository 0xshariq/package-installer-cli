# package-installer-cli — Monorepo

A monorepo that contains the official cross-platform interactive CLI for scaffolding modern application templates and several language-specific wrapper projects and bundles.

This repository groups multiple packages and artifacts used to build, bundle and distribute the `package-installer` CLI (the `pi` / `package-installer` binary). Converting to a monorepo keeps related projects together, simplifies releases, and makes it easier to maintain shared templates and build scripts.

## Monorepo layout

Top-level folders you'll commonly use:

- `core-cli/` — The main TypeScript CLI implementation (core). Contains `package.json`, `src/`, build scripts and the `pi` CLI. Versioned independently (see `core-cli/package.json`).
- `wrappers/python/`, `wrappers/ruby/`, `wrappers/rust/`, `wrappers/go/` — Language-specific wrappers that adapt the CLI or provide language integrations where applicable.
- `wrappers/homebrew-tap/` — Homebrew tap for macOS installations.
- `bundle-executables/`, `bundle-standalone/`, `binary/` — Bundled distributions and prebuilt binaries for different platforms (In core-cli folder).
- `templates/` — Project templates used by the CLI to scaffold new projects (In core-cli folder).
- `docs/` and `features/` — Documentation and feature definitions for templates and integrations (In core-cli folder).

## Quick start (local development)

Prerequisites: Node.js (>=18 recommended), pnpm (preferred), or npm/yarn.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xshariq/package-installer-cli.git
cd package-installer-cli
```

2. Work with the TypeScript core (recommended):

```bash
cd core-cli
# install dependencies (pnpm preferred since lockfile exists)
pnpm install

# build the CLI
pnpm run build

# run locally
pnpm start

# or, using npm
npm install
npm run build
node ./dist/index.js
```

3. Work with other packages

Each wrapper or subpackage is self-contained. To develop a wrapper or build a bundled executable, `cd` into that folder and follow its `README` or run its scripts. For example, to work with the Rust wrapper:

```bash
cd wrappers/rust
# follow the folder's README / use cargo build there
```

## READMEs (paths)

- [Monorepo README](README.md)
- [TypeScript core](core-cli/README.md)
- [Python wrapper](wrappers/python/README.md)
- [Ruby wrapper](wrappers/ruby/README.md)
- [Rust wrapper](wrappers/rust/README.md)
- [Go wrapper](wrappers/go/README.md)
- [Homebrew tap](wrappers/homebrew-tap/README.md)

## Common tasks

- Build core CLI: `cd core-cli && pnpm run build`
- Run CLI locally: `cd core-cli && pnpm start` (or `node ./dist/index.js`)
- Create distribution bundles: `cd tcore-cli && pnpm run build && pnpm run binary && pnpm run bundle` (you can use any package manager other than pnpm)
- Clean builds (dist folder): `cd core-cli && pnpm run clean`

## Contribution & development workflow

- Follow `core-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines, commit messages, and release process.
- When modifying templates, add tests or an example scaffold run to verify the generated project.
- Keep distribution bundles out of commits; they are generated by build scripts.

> Important contribution note

> At the moment, please focus contributions on the TypeScript core located at `core-cli/` only. The language-specific wrappers (Python, Rust, Ruby, Go, etc.) are currently placeholders or partial ports. I will be rewriting each wrapper's full implementation from scratch as I learn those languages properly. Once the wrappers have complete, native implementations, they will be open for external contributions.

> If you'd like to help earlier, please open issues, report bugs, or suggest documentation/template improvements. To avoid duplicate work, please avoid submitting PRs that change wrapper logic until the new implementations are available.

## Releases & packaging

Release steps typically involve:

1. Bumping the version in the package (see `core-cli/package.json`).
2. Building the core and creating distribution bundles (`pnpm run build`, then `pnpm run binary`, and lastly `pnpm run bundle`).
3. Publishing packages or uploading release assets (binaries, installers, Homebrew tap updates).

Automations (CI) may exist in `.github/workflows/` inside package folders — check each package for its own CI configuration.
